= About Enterprise Contract Policy

The HACBS Enterprise Contract Policy defines the configuration for the
enforcement of the Enterprise Contract policy by specifying rules and
authorizations needed for a container image built in HACKBS to be compliant with
organization's software release policy requirements.

The Enterprise Contract Policy is passed in the form of a configuration to the
xref:ec-cli:ROOT:index.adoc[EC CLI] to
parameterize its execution in the enforcement of the set policy.

== How to create Enterprise Contract Policy

When creating Enterprise Contract Policy first make note of what rule sources to
include, any authorization approval requirements and the public key needed to
validate the image and attestation image signatures.

=== As a JSON file

The resulting data is placed in a JSON document with the following structure:

.policy.json
[source,json]
----
include::example$spec-example.json[]
----

Consult the
xref:reference.adoc#k8s-api-github-com-hacbs-contract-enterprise-contract-controller-api-v1alpha1-enterprisecontractpolicyspec[the
EnterpriseContractPolicySpec reference] documentation for details on the
structure of this document.

The policy in JSON format can be passed in directly to the `ec` command line
using the `-p`/`--policy` option, for example in the
xref:ec-cli:ROOT:ec_validate_image.adoc[`validate image`] command.

=== As a Kubernetes Custom Resource

It is more common to create the Enterprise Contract Policy as a Kubernetes
Custom Resource and pass the reference to the namespace and the name of the
Custom Resource to the `-p`/`--policy` option. This has the advantage that the
policy is centraly defined and served from the Kubernetes API server with the
additional benefit of applying role based access control.
